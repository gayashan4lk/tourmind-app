# background
Sri Lanka has many places of interest that are not well documented online, especially at local
level. Tourists visiting these areas often struggle to find reliable, organised information to
plan a one-day visit.
In this project, you will design and implement a web-based system to help a tourist plan a
one-day visit to places of interest located within a 25 km radius of your home.
