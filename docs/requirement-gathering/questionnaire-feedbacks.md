1. What details about a tourist site are most important to you before you decide to visit it?

First, I want to understand what the place is actually about and why it’s worth visiting. A short explanation, some good photos, and the main highlights are important to me. I also need practical details like how far it is, how long I might spend there, and whether it’s suitable for a relaxed day visit.

2. Do you prefer a brief summary or detailed descriptions of each place?

When I’m just exploring options, I prefer a short summary because I don’t want to read too much at once. But if a place catches my interest, I would like to see a more detailed description available.

3. How do you typically plan the order of places to visit in a single day?

I usually check which places are close to each other and try to group them. I also consider opening times — for example, I might visit places that open earlier first. Travel time and traffic also affect how I plan the order.

4. Do you need information about the best time of day or year to visit a place?

Yes, especially for outdoor places. In Sri Lanka, weather matters a lot. I would prefer to know if a place is better in the morning, evening, or during a specific season.

5. What details do you need before visiting a site (e.g., opening hours, entry fees, dress codes, parking)?

I definitely need to know the opening and closing times and whether there is an entry fee. If it’s a religious site, I’d like to know about dress codes. Parking information is also useful, especially if I’m traveling by car.

6. What types of attractions interest you most — religious, nature, heritage, cultural, or others?

I personally enjoy nature and heritage sites the most. I also like visiting cultural and religious places if they have historical significance.

7. Do you rely on maps to orient yourself when visiting new places?

Yes, I almost always use maps when I’m going somewhere new. It makes me feel more confident about finding the place without getting lost.

8. Would you prefer an interactive map or a simple location list with directions?

An interactive map would be more helpful because I can see everything visually. But having written directions as well would be good in case I need them.

9. Do you prefer browsing on a mobile phone or a desktop/laptop?

Most of the time I use my mobile phone, especially while traveling. But if I’m planning in advance at home, I might use my laptop.

10. Which three features do you consider absolutely essential?

The three most important features for me would be:

Clear and accurate location information

Updated details like opening hours and fees

A simple way to plan multiple places in one day

1. What details about a tourist site are most important to you before you decide to visit it?
I want to know what kind of place it is, like a temple, a beach, a fort or something like that. Then I want to know how far it is from where I am staying and whether it is worth the travel time. Also the reviews from other people who visited, that matters a lot to me before i decide to go.


2. Do you prefer a brief summary or detailed descriptions of each place?
I prefer a brief summary first, just two or three sentences to get the idea. If I feel interested then I will read more. Too much writing at the beginning makes me skip.


3. How do you typically plan the order of places to visit in a single day?
I start with the nearest place in the morning and then go further as the day goes. Also I try to visit religious places like temples early in the morning because that is the proper time. Then lunch in the middle and sightseeing or nature places in the evening when it is not so hot.


4. Do you need information about the best time of day or year to visit a place?
In Sri Lanka the weather can be tricky, monsoon season can ruin a whole trip if you don't know. Also some temples have specific puja times and some places get very crowded at certain hours. So knowing the best time to visit is really helpful for me.


5. What details do you need before visiting a site?
I don’t want to go all the way and find the gate is closed. Entry fees are also very important especially if I am travelling with my family. Dress code matters too because for temple visits we need to cover our shoulders and wear a sarong sometimes. Parking is also good to know because some places in the city are very difficult to park.


6. What types of attractions interest you most?
Personally I love religious and heritage places like ancient temples, dutch forts, colonial buildings. Nature places like lagoons, mangroves and beaches also I enjoy very much. Cultural sites where I can learn about our history are very interesting to me. I am not so much into shopping or entertainment type attractions to be honest.

7. Do you rely on maps to orient yourself when visiting new places?
Yes, without a map I get confused easily especially in areas I have never been before. Even if somebody gives me directions i still open google maps just to double check. So the map is quite important for me.


8. Would you prefer an interactive map or a simple location list with directions?
An interactive map is better for me, I can see all the places at once and plan my route properly. A location list alone is a bit boring and hard to visualize. But the map should be simple and not too complicated, i dont want too many buttons and options confusing me.


9. Do you prefer browsing on a mobile phone or a desktop/laptop?
Mobile phone, I am always on my phone when I am travelling, I check places, directions, everything from my phone. Desktop, I use it only when I am sitting at home doing something serious. So the web application should work nicely on the mobile screen.


10. Which three features do you consider absolutely essential?
Interactive map showing all nearby places clearly.
The opening hours and entry fees for each place because without that practical information it is not very useful.
A suggested itinerary or route for the day, something that tells me to start here then go here then finish here.

01.Before deciding to visit a tourist site, I usually want to know its exact location, why it is worth to visit, and what kind of place. also, I need practical information such as, opening hours, parking facilities, entry fees, food shop and availability of the restroom.

02. I prefer both of them, when I am deciding quickly A short summery is helpful. but if I genuinely interested in a place, I would like to see more detailed description. so, A system provides both- "read more" feature ensures flexibility and offers different scheduling styles.

03. I typically plan the order of visits based on distance and travel time; I check google maps for distances. and start with the farthest place in the morning, then move closer to town. first of all, plan around opening and closing time, like temples in the morning, beaches in the evening.

04.Information about the best time of day or season to visit is very important. such as, museums are better in the morning, beaches and lagoons are more enjoyable. seasonal advice, such as avoiding lagoons areas during rain, so knowing the best time/season to visit is really helpful for me.

05. I need to know the opening/closing times, so I don't need to be disappointed. Entry fees are important to me if I want to travel to many places. Also parking availability and restroom facilities are important. Safety tips, such as swimming condition at beach or restricted area in heritage sites, are also highly valued.

06. When it comes to travelling, I love all of them. but personally, Heritage and Nature are my favourite places.

07. Yes, always. I use Google maps for directions and nearby facilities. Without maps It's hard to navigate unfamiliar areas. so, map integration is a must have feature in tourism planner app.

08. Interactive map is better. because I can see routes and nearby places. But having simple location list with directions also helpful as a backup if internet is slow, I need that.

09.I always use my mobile phone, especially while traveling. But if I am planning in advance at home, I use only laptop.

10. The 3 most essential features for me are, an interactive Maps with routes and travel time. Accurate place details such as closing/opening hours, fees and safety tips. Also, a simple and suggested one-day itinerary.
