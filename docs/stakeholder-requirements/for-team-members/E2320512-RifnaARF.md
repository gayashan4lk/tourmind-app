Hi,

I am building a web application to help local tourist to plan one-day visit to my hometown. This web application is to help tourist in organizing their day and finding nearby places to visit.

As local tourist, kindly answer the following questions in order to gather stakeholder requirements for this project.

01. What would you expect from a one-day visit plan app?

02. What challenges do you usually face when planning a short trip?

03. Which features would be most useful for you as a tourist? (e.g.: maps, timing, attraction, food option)

04. What would make you trust this app as a tourist?

05. What would disappoint you if the app was missing?
