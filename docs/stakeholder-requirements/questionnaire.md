Hi,

E2320336 Ali MT, E2320161 Larusan W, E2320512 Rifna ARF, E2320193 Thacshaayan S,

I am building a web application to help a local tourist to plan a one-day visit at my home. This web application will help the tourist to plan his/her day and visit places near my home. As local tourist, kindly answer below questions in order to gather stakeholder requirements for this project.

What details about a tourist site are most important to you before you decide to visit it?
Do you prefer a brief summary or detailed descriptions of each place?
How do you typically plan the order of places to visit in a single day?
Do you need information about the best time of day or year to visit a place?
What details do you need before visiting a site (e.g., opening hours, entry fees, dress codes, parking)?
What types of attractions interest you most — religious, nature, heritage, cultural, or others?
Do you rely on maps to orient yourself when visiting new places?
Would you prefer an interactive map or a simple location list with directions?
Do you prefer browsing on a mobile phone or a desktop/laptop?
Which three features do you consider absolutely essential?
