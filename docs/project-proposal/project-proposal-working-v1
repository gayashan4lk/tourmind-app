# TourMind – Project Proposal
### A Web-Based One-Day Visit Planning System for Matara, Sri Lanka

---

## Introduction

Matara is a historic coastal city situated on the southern tip of Sri Lanka, approximately 160 kilometres from Colombo. Rich in colonial heritage, natural beauty, and Buddhist culture, the area within a 25 km radius of Matara town centre encompasses a diverse range of attractions — from the iconic Dondra Head Lighthouse and the Dutch-built Star Fort, to the serene Polhena Beach, the sacred Weherahena Temple, and the wildlife-rich Nilwala River. The region draws a growing number of local and international tourists who are drawn to its relatively uncrowded beaches, historical monuments, and spiritual sites, yet it remains far less visited than neighbouring destinations such as Mirissa and Galle.

Despite its wealth of attractions, Matara lacks a centralised, reliable source of tourist information at the local level. Visitors must piece together itinerary details from multiple, often outdated, online sources, making it difficult to plan an efficient and enjoyable one-day visit. TourMind is a web-based system designed to address this gap by providing organised, host-curated information about places of interest within a 25 km radius of a homestay in Matara, enabling tourists to plan their visit with confidence.

## Problem Statement

Tourists visiting the Matara area face significant difficulty in finding reliable, organised, and locally relevant information about places of interest, as details are scattered across travel blogs, social media, and general tourism directories with inconsistent accuracy. There is currently no dedicated platform that consolidates place descriptions, opening times, distances, travel tips, and map locations into a single, locally managed resource for this specific region. This absence of a structured information system results in poorly planned visits, missed attractions, and a diminished overall tourist experience — a problem that directly affects both visitor satisfaction and the potential for local tourism growth.

---

## Aim

The aim of this project is to design and implement a web-based system, TourMind, that enables tourists to access organised, host-curated information about places of interest within a 25 km radius of a homestay in Matara, Sri Lanka, and to plan a personalised one-day visit itinerary.

---

## Project Objectives

1. To identify and document a minimum of 10 places of interest within a 25 km radius of the Matara homestay, covering categories including historical sites, beaches, religious sites, natural attractions, and local food.
2. To design and implement a tourist-facing interface that allows users to browse, filter, and view detailed information — including descriptions, opening hours, travel tips, and distances — for each place of interest.
3. To develop an interactive map feature that displays the geographical location of each place of interest relative to the homestay.
4. To implement a one-day visit plan builder that allows tourists to select multiple places of interest and organise them into a personalised daily itinerary.
5. To build a host-facing management interface that allows the homestay owner to add, edit, and delete place information without technical assistance.
6. To deliver a fully functional, responsive web application using Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL that performs reliably across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Scope and Limitations

### Scope

The system will cover a minimum of 10 places of interest located within a 25 km radius of the Matara homestay, spanning multiple categories including historical and colonial landmarks, beaches and coastal attractions, Buddhist and religious sites, natural attractions, and restaurants or local food experiences. The system will provide tourists with the ability to view place listings, filter by category, read essential details, view locations on a map, and compose a one-day visit plan. A separate host interface will allow the homestay owner to manage place information through add, edit, and delete operations.

The representative places of interest to be included are:

| # | Place | Category |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | Matara Fort | Historical landmark |
| 2 | Star Fort and Museum | Historical landmark |
| 3 | Old Dutch Trade Centre / Nupe Market | Heritage site |
| 4 | Dutch Reformed Church | Heritage and religious site |
| 5 | Paravi Duwa Buddhist Temple | Religious site |
| 6 | Weherahena Temple | Religious and cultural site |
| 7 | Wewurukannala Viharaya, Dickwella | Religious site |
| 8 | Dondra Head Lighthouse | Natural and historical landmark |
| 9 | Polhena Beach | Beach and snorkelling |
| 10 | Mirissa Beach and Coconut Tree Hill | Beach and scenic viewpoint |
| 11 | Nilwala River Safari | Nature and wildlife |
| 12 | Madiha Beach | Beach |

### Limitations

The system will not include any booking or reservation functionality for tours, accommodation, or transport. It will not support payment processing of any kind. The system will not provide hotel or transport recommendations or reservations. Real-time updates — such as live crowd levels or dynamic pricing for nearby services — are also outside the scope of this project.

## Target Users

**Tourists** are the primary users of the system. This group includes both local Sri Lankan visitors and international travellers who are staying in or passing through the Matara area and wish to make the most of a single day of sightseeing. They require clear, reliable information and a straightforward way to plan their visit without needing to consult multiple external sources.

**The Host** is the homestay owner responsible for managing the content of the system. The host acts as the local expert and curator, maintaining accurate and up-to-date information about each place of interest. The host requires a simple, non-technical management interface to add new places, edit existing entries, and remove outdated information as needed.

---

## Proposed System Overview

TourMind will function as a web application with two distinct interfaces: a public-facing tourist interface and a password-protected host management interface.

On the tourist side, the system will present a browsable list of places of interest, each accompanied by a description, category tag, opening hours, estimated distance from the homestay, travel tips, and an embedded map pin. Tourists will be able to filter the list by category — such as beaches, historical sites, or religious sites — to quickly identify places that match their interests. A dedicated map view will allow users to see all places plotted geographically. The one-day plan builder will allow tourists to select multiple places from the list and arrange them into a simple, ordered itinerary for the day.

On the host side, a secure login interface will provide access to a management dashboard. From this dashboard, the host will be able to add new places of interest by completing a structured form, edit the details of existing entries, and permanently delete places that are no longer relevant or accessible.

The system will be developed as a responsive web application, ensuring usability on both desktop browsers and mobile devices, as tourists are likely to access the system while travelling.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js (React-based framework for server-side rendering and responsive UI) |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python-based REST API framework) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (relational database for structured place and user data) |
| Development Tools | Visual Studio Code |
| Version Control | Git |

## Conclusion

TourMind addresses a genuine and underserved need in the local tourism landscape of Matara, Sri Lanka. By consolidating host-curated information about places of interest into a single, accessible web platform, the system has the potential to meaningfully improve the experience of tourists visiting the area while also providing a valuable tool for the homestay host to promote local attractions. As an academic project, TourMind offers the opportunity to apply and demonstrate competency across the full stack of modern web development — from database design and API development to responsive frontend implementation. The expected outcome is a functional, well-designed system that serves as a practical prototype for locally managed tourism information platforms in underrepresented regions of Sri Lanka.
